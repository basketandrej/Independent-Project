        <h2 class="title-left">Francis Bacon</h2>
        <div class="visual-artist-text-right">
          <p>Francis Bacon was a British painter born on October 28, 1909, in Dublin, Ireland. He was the second of five children born to English parents, who lived in Ireland for several years before moving back to England. Bacon’s father was a racehorse trainer, and his mother was a keen amateur artist who encouraged her son’s interest in art from an early age.</p>
          <p>Bacon’s early life was marked by tragedy, as his father disapproved of his artistic pursuits and sent him away to boarding school. In 1926, when Bacon was just 17 years old, he moved to Berlin and lived there for a few years before returning to London in 1929. In the years that followed, he struggled to establish himself as an artist, often living in poverty and relying on the support of friends and benefactors.</p>
          <p>Bacon’s early work was heavily influenced by the Surrealist movement, which was popular in Europe at the time. His paintings were often dark and disturbing, featuring distorted figures and abstracted forms. In 1944, Bacon achieved his first major success when his painting “Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion” was exhibited at the Lefevre Gallery in London.</p>
          <p>Bacon died on April 28, 1992, in Madrid, Spain, at the age of 82. Despite his fame and critical acclaim, he remained a private and enigmatic figure throughout his life, rarely giving interviews or discussing his work in public. Today, his paintings are among the most sought-after works of art in the world, and his influence can be seen in the work of many contemporary artists.</p>

        <h2 class="title-right">Zdzisław Beksiński</h2>
        <div class="visual-artist-text-left">
          <p>Zdzisław Beksiński was a Polish artist known for his dark, surrealistic paintings that often featured grotesque figures and dystopian landscapes. He was born on February 24, 1929, in Sanok, Poland. Beksiński initially studied architecture at the Krakow University of Technology but soon realized his true passion was in art. He began his artistic career as a photographer and sculptor before eventually turning to painting in the 1950s.</p>
          <p>Beksiński’s early paintings were often abstract and influenced by Surrealism, but he eventually developed his own unique style that was characterized by highly detailed and vivid imagery. His works often featured twisted, surreal creatures and post-apocalyptic environments, which he created using a technique that involved layering multiple media, including paint, charcoal, and photography.
          </p>
          <p>Despite the disturbing nature of his work, Beksiński became one of the most important and influential artists in Poland. His paintings were exhibited widely both in his home country and abroad, and he also worked as a book illustrator, creating cover art for numerous science fiction novels.
          </p>
          <p>Tragically, Beksiński was murdered in his Warsaw apartment on February 21, 2005, at the age of 76. The motive for his murder remains unknown, but it is believed to have been committed by a young man who had previously been in a dispute with Beksiński’s son. His death shocked the art world and left a void in the Polish cultural scene.</p>
